__An server software for Minecraft 1.2__

**WARNING! This server software isn't compatible with Minecraft: Java Edition**

Introduction
-------------
Prismarine is a server software based on **[PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP)** with extended functionality. Most of the original code was written by **PocketMine Team**.<br>
Some of the extended functionality that Prismarine offers:

* Online-mode
* Working enchantments - W.I.P - 8/26 of enchantments working
* Critical hits

However, Prismarine still has a long way to go. We welcome contributions.
